<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
Airborne full waveform LiDAR contains more information and allows for additional detailed analysis for scientific concepts like forest structure, biomass, carbon content, and more. NEON full-waveform is a unique open source dataset that contains high-resolution (often 1m) full-waveform LiDAR continuously flown over many different sites. However, this data is hard to process and use. This repository contains a set of functions to process NEON full-waveform LiDAR data. Many of the functions in this repository can be modified on a per usage basis, but provide a good starting foundation for analysis. Other functions in this repository are built to predict above ground biomass using this type of LiDAR data.

## Documentation/Usage

There are two main files: neon_processor_batch and neon_processor_full. Neon_processor_batch is a quicker way to analyze pulsewaves data than the full processor, but it does not filter based on geolocation data. Therefore, if you already know the pulsenumbers you want to analyze or want to test out functions first, use neon_processor_batch. However, if you want to filter out the pulsewaves file based on geolocation and then analyze it, use neon_processor_full. Neon_processor_full differs as it finds all the waveforms in the specified geolocation area, and then the waveform_aoi variable is used for further analysis instead of specific pulsewave numbers

The general workflow of the code is to create a main pandas/excel table of waveform relative elevation data, waveform geolocation information, in situ biomass values, and k-means cluster assignments to get all the data in one place. Then, all analysis functions such as regression and k-means clustering are done by feeding in this table as input. See the **cumulative_waveform_analysis_main** function for more details.
